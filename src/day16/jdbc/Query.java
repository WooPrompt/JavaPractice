    // 1. Generalization: Multiple classes can share the same contract, regardless of implementation details.
    // 2. Polymorphism: Enables handling different classes uniformly through the interface type.
    // 3. Scalability: Changing implementations wonâ€™t break existing code as long as the interface stays consistent.
